NOTE: This video file cannot be generated as it's a binary asset. 

The file should be the construction site sunrise aerial loop video provided in the attached assets (Construction_Site_Sunrise_Aerial_Loop_1757249969252.mp4).

To complete the implementation:
1. Copy the provided video file to this location: public/assets/hero/Construction_Site_Sunrise_Aerial_Loop.mp4
2. Ensure the video is optimized for web delivery (H.264 codec, reasonable file size)
3. Consider creating a poster image frame from the video for faster loading

The application is already configured to handle this video file with:
- Autoplay, loop, muted attributes
- Reduced motion support
- Play/pause controls
- Proper accessibility labeling
- Fallback handling

All other components are properly implemented and ready to use once this video asset is in place.
