# Replit Agent Prompt — Package Keane Site Services Website for Netlify Deployment

Objective:
Generate a clean, production-ready zip file of the Keane Site Services site that reflects all recent changes (toolbar fixes, services page refinements, Netlify form integration, performance upgrades, DNS-safe configs, and thank-you page). The exported zip must deploy successfully on Netlify without errors.

Tasks:
1. Collect all project files needed for a static export:
   - index.html
   - /services/*.html (all service detail pages)
   - /public/styles.css
   - /public/app.js
   - /assets/* (all images, logos, hero video, icons)
   - /thank-you.html
   - netlify.toml (with caching + security headers)

2. Ensure HTML and assets are self-contained:
   - All `<script>` references use relative paths.
   - All `<link rel="stylesheet">` paths are relative.
   - Form markup includes the correct Netlify attributes (`data-netlify="true"`, hidden form-name, honeypot).
   - No absolute local paths (only relative `/assets/...` or `/public/...`).

3. Verify site loads locally without missing assets:
   - Logo appears in header + services pages.
   - Hero video background renders properly on Home.
   - Toolbar transparency/scroll transition logic remains intact.
   - Services navigation opens at the **top** of each page (not mid-scroll).
   - White line under service page header is removed.
   - Footer links are functional and bring users to correct sections.
   - "Why Choose Keane Site Services" section corrected.

4. Optimize:
   - Ensure all non-critical images are `loading="lazy" decoding="async"`.
   - Include width/height attributes to avoid CLS.
   - Scripts marked `defer`.
   - Hero logo and video poster set `fetchpriority="high"`.

5. Package:
   - Output a zip file named `keane-site-services-netlify.zip` containing the full build.
   - Place at project root `/mnt/data/keane-site-services-netlify.zip`.

Deliverables:
- One zip archive with all updated project files ready for drag-and-drop deployment in Netlify.
- No missing assets, no broken links, no dependency errors.
- Confirmed reproducible deployment on Netlify.
