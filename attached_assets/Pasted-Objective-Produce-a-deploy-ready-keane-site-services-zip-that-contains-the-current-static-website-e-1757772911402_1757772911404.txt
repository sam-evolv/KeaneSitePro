Objective: Produce a deploy-ready keane-site-services.zip that contains the current static website exactly as it renders now. No code changes that could alter behavior. Validate that all local asset references resolve.
Guardrails
Do not change HTML structure, content, CSS, or JS logic.
Do not alter header/toolbar behavior, hero video, or service pages.
Only add non-invasive deploy metadata files alongside existing files (safe defaults).
Use relative paths as they exist now; do not rewrite links.
Steps
Create export directory
Create /dist (empty).
Copy all site files and folders into /dist, preserving structure:
index.html
/services/** (all service pages)
/public/** (css/js)
/assets/** (images, video, brand, icons, etc.)
Any favicon / web manifest files
(Optional but recommended) Add Netlify config without changing behavior
Write /dist/netlify.toml with safe defaults:
[build]
  publish = "."

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Strict-Transport-Security = "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-Frame-Options = "SAMEORIGIN"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
If a thank-you.html exists, do nothing else.
Do not add redirects unless they already exist.
Preserve Netlify Forms (if used)
If any form has data-netlify="true", ensure its name and hidden form-name match. Do not modify forms; only verify presence. If absent, skip.
Validation pass
Verify that every <link href>, <script src>, <img src>, <video src/poster>, and <source srcset> in /dist points to a file that exists under /dist. Fail the build if any are missing and output the offending paths.
Confirm that the hero video file(s) are copied and the total ZIP size is reasonable (<100 MB). Do not compress media further.
ZIP packaging
Create keane-site-services.zip from the contents of /dist (so the root of the ZIP contains index.html, not a nested /dist folder).
Output the absolute path to the ZIP.
Smoke test (local file open)
Open /dist/index.html in the Replit preview to ensure CSS/JS load and hero media renders. Do not change code; just report status.
Acceptance Criteria
keane-site-services.zip exists and unzips to a flat site tree with index.html at root.
All asset references resolve; no broken links or missing files reported.
No HTML/CSS/JS content or behaviors were altered.
If Netlify Forms are present, name/hidden form-name alignment is confirmed (no mutation).
Provide a short summary with:
ZIP path
File count and total size
Any non-blocking warnings (if any)
Deliverable: keane-site-services.zip ready for drag-and-drop on Netlify Deploys.
