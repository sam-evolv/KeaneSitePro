You are working in the Keane Site Services project. Goal: change the service name "Waste Collection" to "Delapodation Work" everywhere it is user-visible, including headings, buttons, cards, menu anchors, form labels, alt text, FAQs, and schema metadata. Do not alter layout, spacing, colors, component structure, or any other services. This is a text-only change.

Guardrails
- Do not change any pricing values or other service names.
- Do not touch CSS except for text content inside existing elements.
- Do not remove or add components.
- Only change exact user-facing strings and their slugs where they refer to this service.
- If the project uses a data source (JSON/TS/JS object) for services, update only the entry for Waste Collection.

Plan
1) Create a safety branch:
   - git checkout -b chore/rename-waste-collection-to-delapodation-work

2) Locate all occurrences:
   - Search codebase for case-insensitive matches:
     "Waste Collection", "Waste collection", "Waste Collection Service", "Waste Collection Services", "waste-collection", "waste_collection".
   - Typical locations to scan:
     /public and /assets content files
     /index.html or root HTML
     src/pages/**, src/components/**, src/sections/**
     src/data/services.* (json|js|ts)
     navigation/menu files
     forms and validation schemas
     SEO meta and Open Graph tags
     schema.org JSON-LD blocks
     image alt attributes and aria-labels
     tests if present

3) Apply targeted replacements:
   - Visible text: replace with "Delapodation Work"
   - Headings and cards: "Waste Collection" -> "Delapodation Work"
   - Buttons/CTAs: "Book Waste Collection" -> "Book Delapodation Work"
   - Menu anchors: "Waste Collection" -> "Delapodation Work"
   - Form labels/placeholders: update to "Delapodation Work"
   - FAQs and service descriptions: change the service name only, leave other text unchanged
   - Alt text and aria-labels: update name only

4) Slugs and anchors
   - If a slug or id is "waste-collection", rename to "delapodation-work"
   - Update internal links that target that slug, for example:
     href="#waste-collection" -> href="#delapodation-work"
     /services/waste-collection -> /services/delapodation-work
   - If Netlify redirects file exists, add a 301:
     From: /services/waste-collection
     To:   /services/delapodation-work
     Status: 301
     File: netlify.toml or _redirects depending on project. Use the project’s current pattern.

5) Data driven content
   - If services are defined in a data file, update only this object:
     name: "Delapodation Work"
     slug: "delapodation-work"
     Keep the same id and pricing fields.
   - Do not reorder arrays.

6) Schema and SEO
   - If JSON-LD Service or Product schema exists for this item, update "name" to "Delapodation Work".
   - If there is a dedicated SEO title or meta description for the Waste Collection page, update the name string only. Do not change keywords beyond the name.

7) Images
   - If an image filename contains the old slug, leave the underlying file as is to avoid breaking paths.
   - Only update human-readable captions and alt text.

8) Build and validate
   - Run the dev server and click through:
     Header menu item for the service navigates correctly
     Services grid card shows "Delapodation Work"
     Any "Book" or "Learn more" buttons show the correct label and still work
     Anchor links scroll to the correct section
   - Run build to ensure no type or import errors.

9) Commit with a clear message:
   - git add -A
   - git commit -m "chore: rename Waste Collection to Delapodation Work across UI, anchors, forms, SEO, and schema. No layout changes."

10) Output a concise change report:
   - List files changed and a brief note for each
   - Confirm any redirects created
   - Confirm all links updated and build success
